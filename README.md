## Purpose

I found that Carlsberg Group website focus on their different beer types, while the best Beer for me is Carlsberg.
Its a fully responsive website which allow the Carlsberg beer lovers find their prefered beer taste. 
They can find answers for the most asked questions by customers.
They can find all upcomming events for carlsberg beer only.

Please note, this website is not related to Carlsberg group, its a personal project, using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules.

## Design 

### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used across the website are an white and green to tie in with TCarlsberg's product offering - beers. Furthermore, a dark grey was used for the paragraph text, instead of black, to improve its contrast and readability on screens.

Adobe Color was used to create a colour pattern to find the right shade of green for the site. A dark green was used for the H1 headings and a lighter shade of green was used for icons and buttons. 

**Adobe Color Pattern:**

### Wireframes

Carlsberg Group's website is a single page site. A single page design was chosen because the website has a narrow focus and is purely informational. Furthermore it's ideal for a mobile first design and users will have less clicking to do to find the information they need. 

Please see the wireframes below for the varying devices:

* [Wireframe](https://github.com/mihaidouss/carlsberg-group/blob/master/wireframe/CarlsbergGroup%20wireframe.pdf)

### Typography

The fonts originally chosen for this website were [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair), 
based on some google search based on commercially with product recommended font. However, once I commenced building the site, 
I didn't feel that Playfair Display tied into the branding I had in mind for Carlsberg Beer - a tasty beer who's knowledgeable about their taste.

I trialed new fonts using Google Fonts and Google Chrome Developer tools to view sample text from Carlsberg's website in various fonts before applying them to the website. Furthermore, I took guidance from Google Font's "Popular Pairings" to find new fonts.  

I decided to change Playfair Display to [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=roboto) instead. Roboto Slab offers a more fun font with its friendly and open curves, versus Playfair which has a more vintage feel to it. 

### Imagery

The website uses strong and impactful Beers imagery to reinforce Carlsberg product offering and to also appeal to the website user. These images were sourced from [Carlsberg](www.carlsberggroup.com) and are referenced in the code. In addition, the images give structure and dimension to the website and help provide the user with a positive user experience. The size and positioning of these images varies depending on the screen size. 

Lots of white space was used to help structure and organise the content and images on the page, improve the user experience and legibility of text on the site.

## Features

The website is a single page site and is broken down into eight sections. Each section is described in more detail below along with its features and how they meet the visitor goals outlined in the user stories: 

### Existing Features

**Section 1 - Navbar**

The navbar is fully responsive and collapses down into a hamburger menu on smaller devices. It provides a full list of links to access each of the key sections on the website and remains fixed to the top on all devices so the user can easily navigate the site without scrolling.

**Section 2 - Hero Image**

The hero image sets the scene for Carlsberg's product offering by displaying a large and enticing image of Beer Cup and descriptive text overlaying it. 

It includes a CTA which directs users to the Head Office Opening Hours/ Contact Us section of the website. The text displayed shortens down to just the H1 heading on mobile devices so as not to obstruct the users view of the attractive Beer image.
